            <p>[SOUND] Previously we spoke about one type of alternative element positioning and that's floating
                elements. I say alternative because it is It is alternative to the normal document flow. This
                lecture, we're going to speak about a couple more positioning schemes, and that's relative and
                absolute. These positioning schemes allow you to specify precise offsets to move the target
                element
                to the different part of the page origin.
